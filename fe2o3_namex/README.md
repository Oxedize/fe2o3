# Oxedize Hematite (fe2o3)

Hematite is a collection of crates built from first principles, providing foundational tools for building robust applications.  See the [github repo](https://github.com/Oxedize/fe2o3) for more information.

## This crate

This is a fundamental crate providing a universal name codex (Namex) system for managing identifiers across distributed systems. It implements:

- A decentralised, versionless database for mapping 32-byte identifiers to entities
- Support for over 4 billion identifier families, each with over 65,000 variants
- JDAT-based storage format with human-readable export options
- Rich entity metadata including names, descriptions, timestamps, and cross-references
- Language-aware naming with alternative name support
- Hierarchical tagging system for flexible categorisation

The crate aims to solve the challenge of maintaining consistent naming across distributed systems while preserving backwards compatibility and human readability.
