# Oxedize Hematite (fe2o3)

Hematite is a collection of crates built from first principles, providing foundational tools for building robust applications.  See the [github repo](https://github.com/Oxedize/fe2o3) for more information.

## This crate

This crate provides a terminal user interface (TUI) library and the Iron Interactive Console (Ironic). The library offers abstractions for building terminal-based applications with features like:

- Modal editing inspired by Vi/Vim
- Windowing system with draggable/resizable windows 
- Tab-based interface for organizing content
- Customisable styles and colours
- Scrollbars and status indicators
- File tree navigation
- Support for both static and editable text views

Ironic builds on these capabilities to provide a general purpose terminal interface with:

- Multiple independent windows
- Navigation, editing and window management modes
- Configurable key bindings
- Support for files, logs, shells and menus
- Built-in help system
