In Linux, ports below 1024 are considered privileged, and only the root user can bind to them by default. This is a security feature to prevent unauthorized users from binding to well-known ports.

# Using iptables and Port Forwarding

If you prefer not to grant additional capabilities to your application, another approach is to use iptables to forward traffic from port 443 to a higher, non-privileged port that your application can bind to.

1. Run your application on an unprivileged port (e.g., 8443).

2. Set up iptables to forward traffic from port 443 to the port your application is using bash:

    sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8443

This approach doesn't require giving special permissions to your application, as the port forwarding is handled by the kernel.
