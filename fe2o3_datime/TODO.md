## Research & Implementation Notes

### External Database Integration Approaches

Based on research of other popular date/time libraries:

**1. Jiff Approach (Recommended)**:
- Automatically reads from system timezone databases (`/usr/share/zoneinfo` on Unix)
- Falls back to embedded data when system data unavailable  
- Provides user consent mechanisms
- Detects timezone rule conflicts automatically
- Cross-platform support (Unix, Windows, Android)

**2. Chrono-TZ Approach**:
- Static timezone data compiled into binary at build time
- Requires rebuilding application to get timezone updates
- Uses `CHRONO_TZ_TIMEZONE_FILTER` environment variable for selective inclusion
- No automatic updates - more secure but less convenient

**3. Hybrid Approach (✅ IMPLEMENTED in fe2o3_calclock)**:
- [x] Default: Embedded timezone data for security and reliability
- [x] Optional: System timezone integration with user consent
- [x] Configuration flags to control update behavior
- [x] Validation to detect conflicts between embedded and system data
- [x] Graceful fallback when system data unavailable or corrupted

**Implementation Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Full Jiff-style system timezone integration implemented with all major features working.

## Future Considerations

### 18. Advanced Features
- [ ] Add astronomical calculations (sunrise/sunset, moon phases)
- [ ] Support for geological time scales
- [ ] Add financial calendar support (settlement dates, holidays)
- [ ] Implement interval algebra operations
- [ ] Add support for partial dates (e.g., "June 2024" without day)

## Architecture

### 19. Code Quality
- [ ] Review and refactor error handling patterns
- [ ] Ensure consistent API design across modules
- [ ] Add #[must_use] attributes where appropriate
- [ ] Review and optimize memory usage
- [ ] Consider const fn where possible

### 20. Feature Flags
- [ ] Add feature flags for optional components
- [ ] Create minimal build configuration
- [ ] Allow disabling specific timezone databases
- [ ] Make validation framework optional
- [ ] Support no_std environments better
