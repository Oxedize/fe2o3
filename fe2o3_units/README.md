# Oxedize Hematite (fe2o3)

Hematite is a collection of crates built from first principles, providing foundational tools for building robust applications.  See the [github repo](https://github.com/Oxedize/fe2o3) for more information.

## This crate

This is a fundamental crate providing support for working with scientific units and measurements. It implements proper handling of SI units, prefixes and dimensions, with both decimal and binary scaling systems. The library focuses on correctness and proper dimensional analysis, tracking significant figures, and providing human-friendly output formatting. Features include automatic scale normalisation, unit validation, and a flexible System trait for defining new unit systems beyond SI. The crate is particularly useful for scientific computing, data size representations, and any application requiring precise handling of physical quantities.
