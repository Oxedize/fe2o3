Mainly refactor of err!

README.md
- Added logo.
fe2o3_core:
- Added line and file numbering directly into err! so err!(errmsg!(...)) now should be just err!(..).  Refactored library.  Landed on preferred formatting update of err! statements, a bit inconsistently applied at the moment, see fe2o3_o3db where it's generally implemented.
fe2o3_steel:
- "localhost" -> "localhost." for default domain name in server cfg.
