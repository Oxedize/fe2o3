# Oxedize Hematite (fe2o3)

Hematite is a collection of crates built from first principles, providing foundational tools for building robust applications.  See the [github repo](https://github.com/Oxedize/fe2o3) for more information.

## This crate

This is a major application-level crate providing secure peer-to-peer networking via UDP. The Shield (Signed Hash In Every Little Datagram) protocol offers:

- Security-focused UDP messaging with post-quantum cryptography options
- A lightweight handshake procedure for establishing encrypted sessions
- Robust denial of service mitigation through proof of work validation
- Flexible choice of cryptographic primitives for encryption, signing and key derivation
- Modular design allowing custom protocol implementations

The crate includes both a library for building Shield protocol applications and a reference UDP server implementation.
