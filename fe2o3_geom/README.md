# Oxedize Hematite (fe2o3)

Hematite is a collection of crates built from first principles, providing foundational tools for building robust applications.  See the [github repo](https://github.com/Oxedize/fe2o3) for more information.

## This crate

This is a fundamental geometry crate providing types and utilities for 2D layout and positioning. It implements rectangles, coordinates, and dimensions with both absolute and relative positioning support.  The crate focuses on robust layout calculations with saturating arithmetic to prevent overflow errors.

Key features include:
- Safe dimension types with saturating arithmetic
- Absolute and relative rectangle positioning
- Flexible layout system with padding and fill options
- Clipping and intersection utilities
- Common alignment presets (top-left, centre, etc.)

This crate serves as a foundation for UI layout systems, particularly terminal user interfaces and widget layouts in the Hematite ecosystem.
