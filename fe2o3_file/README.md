Hematite is a collection of crates built from first principles, providing foundational tools for building robust applications.  See the [github repo](https://github.com/Oxedize/fe2o3) for more information.

## This crate

This is a fundamental crate in the Hematite ecosystem that provides file system utilities, with a focus on directory tree traversal and metadata handling. The main feature is the `FileTree` type which creates an in-memory representation of a directory structure, maintaining file attributes like modification times and sizes. It's designed to support efficient hierarchical file system operations while following Hematite's principles of safety and readability.

Key features:
- Tree-based directory structure representation
- File metadata tracking including modification times and sizes  
- Support for both files and directories
- Hierarchical node focusing and selection capabilities
- Efficient sorting and navigation
