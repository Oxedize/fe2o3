# Oxedize Hematite (fe2o3)

Hematite is a collection of crates built from first principles, providing foundational tools for building robust applications.  See the [github repo](https://github.com/Oxedize/fe2o3) for more information.

## This crate

The `fe2o3_bot` crate provides a thread worker abstraction called "bots" for building concurrent Rust applications. Bots are OS-level threads with:

- Built-in identity and labeling
- Communication channels with error handling
- Error counting and warning thresholds
- Graceful termination support
- Common message handling patterns

Bots help reduce boilerplate when implementing concurrent systems by providing reusable patterns for thread management, error handling, and inter-thread communication.
