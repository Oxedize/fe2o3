# Oxedize Hematite (fe2o3)

Hematite is a collection of crates built from first principles, providing foundational tools for building robust applications.  See the [github repo](https://github.com/Oxedize/fe2o3) for more information.

## This crate

This is a fundamental crate providing interoperability traits and implementations for cryptographic operations in Hematite. It defines core traits for key exchange mechanisms (`KeyExchanger`), encryption (`Encrypter`), and digital signatures (`Signer`), along with supporting types for key management. The crate implements these traits using a flexible alternative pattern that allows switching between default and given implementations while maintaining type safety and proper error handling.

## Supporting Development

This project is developed and maintained through GitHub Sponsors. If you find Hematite valuable for your work or interesting as a project, consider supporting its continued development. No special perks or privileges - just sustainable open source development of innovative Rust infrastructure and apps.
