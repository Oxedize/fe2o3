# Oxedize Hematite (fe2o3)

Hematite is a collection of crates built from first principles, providing foundational tools for building robust applications.  See the [github repo](https://github.com/Oxedize/fe2o3) for more information.

## This crate

This is a functional crate providing database interoperability within the Hematite ecosystem. It defines core traits and structures that standardise database operations, particularly for key-value stores. The crate includes support for:

- Generic database operations through the `Database` trait
- Metadata tracking with timestamps and user identification
- Flexible encryption and hashing scheme configuration
- Jdat-based key-value storage
- Standardised error handling and type safety

This crate serves as an abstraction layer between database implementations and consumers, ensuring consistent interfaces whilst allowing customisation of security and performance characteristics.
