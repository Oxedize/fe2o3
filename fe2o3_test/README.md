# Oxedize Hematite (fe2o3)

Hematite is a collection of crates built from first principles, providing foundational tools for building robust applications.  See the [github repo](https://github.com/Oxedize/fe2o3) for more information.

## This crate

The `fe2o3_test` crate provides utilities for generating test data and handling test-related errors in Hematite applications. It includes tools for:

- Creating customisable test data with various arrangements (plain fill, repeated patterns, shuffled sequences)
- Generating random data of specified sizes with configurable fill patterns
- Managing delayed error responses for asynchronous testing scenarios
- Supporting both fixed-size and variable-size data generation

The crate is particularly useful when testing database operations, file system interactions, or any scenario requiring structured test data generation.
